# About this project⚡♻️

## Dataset 

Dataset contains random values and generated by python script. I am putting the code in the case you want to create your own dataset. 

## Code Analysis
1.Data Loading and Explarotary Data Analysis
2.Data Preprocessing
3.Feature Selection
4.Hyperparameter Tuning
5. Model Training and Evaluation

## Some requirements:

Python (version 3.6 or higher)
NumPy
Pandas
Matplotlib
Seaborn
SciPy
Scikit-learn

#### For API implementation
FastAPI
Pickle
Json
Uvicorn
Pyngrok





## Outcome:
After a detailed analysis of the dataset, this project successfully predicts heating and cooling loads for different designs.

## Public API:
I also deployed the model with FastAPI
