## Dataset 

Dataset contains random values and generated by python script. I am putting the code in the case you want to create your own dataset. 

## Some requirements:

Python (version 3.6 or higher)
NumPy
Pandas
Matplotlib
Seaborn
SciPy
Scikit-learn

## Outcome:
After a detailed analysis of the dataset, this project successfully predicts heating and cooling loads for different designs.

## Public API:
